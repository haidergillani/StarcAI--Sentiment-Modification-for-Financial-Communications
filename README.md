### Product Description:  

Research emphasizes that integrating company sentiment data into price prediction models increases predictive accuracy by 20% –– this underlines the growing dependency on sentiment analysis tools in stock price forecasting. Drawing from Keynes’s "castle in the air" theory, the market reacts to what a company communicates, and how that information is presented directly influences investor confidence, in adversity and prosperity alike. An optimistic letter to shareholders bolsters investor confidence, while a pessimistic or uncertain tone stages a panic sell-off. This ripple effect extends to annual reports, social media communications, and other public disclosures by the company.\ 
Recognizing this crucial necessity for businesses worldwide, we introduce STARC: an innovative, automated solution designed to optimize sentiments in corporate communications.\

STARC is an advanced text manipulation model designed to assist companies in influencing investor sentiments through automated sentiment modification. 
STARC quantifies and fine-tunes sentiments of financial text through real-time text generation while preserving context and authenticity. Our proprietary 6-scale financial sentiment quantification model sets a new standard for sentiment refinement, surpassing traditional 3-scale models in precision and nuance. \
The result, a strategic advantage in shaping investor and analyst perception, attracting capital, and favorably influencing stock pricing. STARC allows businesses to strategically improve investor confidence, even in challenging financial situations. STARC aims to revolutionize how companies interact with shareholders and investors, unlocking new avenues for growth and success in the financial landscape.



##### Key Features:
1. **Evaluating the sentiment** of financial text using our 6-scale model and setting desired sentiment score (Figure 2). 
2. **Rewrite or generate new text** to communicate the desired sentiment using a proprietary version of GPT-4, fine-tuned on sentiment scores by our 6-scale FinBERT-tone model. 
3. **Modified text retains the original text's information**, context, and coherence using advanced semantic similarity, topic modeling, and prompt engineering.
4. **Providing real-time feedback** on the sentiment score changes as users modify the text to refine text until it reaches the desired score.
5. **When evaluated by external sentiment analysis tools**, used for predicting stock price changes, STARC-produced text consistently yields the desired sentiment score.

##### Potential Use Cases:
1. **Investor Communications:** Companies can influence investor sentiment through letters to shareholders, earnings reports, and other communication materials, which, in turn, can impact stock prices.
2. **Reputation Management:** Managing brand reputation by modifying the sentiment of public statements and social media posts allows companies to shape and maintain a positive public image.
3. **Financial Analysis:** By evaluating sentiment scores from financial reports or news, analysts and researchers can assess the influence of sentiment on market behavior.
4. **Content Optimization:** Brand marketers and content creators can tailor marketing ads and web content for enhanced audience engagement and desired market actions.

##### Target Audience:
Our target audience ranges from big corporations to smaller startups. STARC is beneficial to any company generating communications that may be analyzed by investors or analysts using sentiment analysis tools, which shapes their confidence in the company. 

##### Competitive Landscape
Currently, no specific company offers a product identical to STARC – which combines sentiment analysis and modification for targeted influence on investor sentiment.\ 
**Sentiment Analysis:** While several companies (Lexalytics, Aylien, MonkeyLearn) provide NLP sentiment analysis for text, they do not offer sentiment modification.\
**Market Research Firms:** Market research firms provide insights into sentiment trends but focus on industry research rather than offering company-facing products.\
**Text Generation Models:** Companies like OpenAI and OpenText offer generic text generation models that lack sentiment manipulation or a quantified sentiment score.
